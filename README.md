# Chatbot with LangChain and Streamlit  

This project is a chatbot application built using **LangChain** and **Streamlit**, designed to process PDFs and provide intelligent responses using embeddings and translation. It includes multiple components such as `app.py`, which serves as the main Streamlit application, `embeddings.py` for handling text embeddings, `pdf_processor.py` for extracting and processing text from PDF documents, and `translation.py` for language translation.  

To set up the project, first, clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git` and navigate to the project directory with `cd your-repo`. Next, create and activate a virtual environment using `python -m venv venv`, followed by `source venv/bin/activate` for Mac/Linux or `venv\Scripts\activate` for Windows. Then, install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  

To run the chatbot, use `streamlit run app.py`. The chatbot provides features such as PDF text extraction, embedding-based responses, and language translation support. The project leverages **LangChain**, **Streamlit**, **Python**, and optionally the **OpenAI API**.
